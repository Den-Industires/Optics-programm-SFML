# Optics-programm-SFML
This is programm for simulation of optics stuff on SFML.

I made this programm for fisics in the college. I made it with SFML on c++.

In this programm you can simulate simple optics. There is not values, so you can see all relatively.

For installation you should just unzip the zip and find an exe, that's all.

You can move and rotate lighet and lens with your mouse (bottoms and wheel). First bottoms in right bottom corner ragulate number of beams in lighter (make it low, is there are lags). Second bottoms in right bottom corner ragulate a focal length of lens.

There is zip with project if you want to see it.

I will be happy, if you interested in my programm. Wellcome.
